                  DataRight+: Energy Account Switch V1
          draft-authors-datarightplus-energy-switch-v1-latest

Abstract

   This specification outlines the technical requirements related to
   functionality to enable an Energy Account switching to be initiated
   under the DataRight+ ecosystem framework.

   Energy Account Switch V1 is intended to be an account opening
   specification for Energy sector participants.  It incorporates
   initiation of the switch with the target Provider, tracking of the
   status of the switch by an Initiator and the optional sharing of
   energy data from the new Provider to the Initiator.

   This specification is considered entirely new functionality currently
   outside the scope of the Australian Consumer Data Right.

1.  Scope

   The scope of this specification is focused on describing the
   authorisation related components of initiating an energy account
   switch to a new Provider, tracking the status of this switch and
   onward sharing to the Initiator of energy account data.

2.  Terms & Definitions

   This specification uses the terms "Agreement Identifier", Consumer",
   "Provider", "Initiator", "Personally Identifiable Information (PII)",
   "Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID)", "Initiator", "CDR Sharing
   Arrangement" and "CDR Sharing Agreement Identifier" as defined by
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-ROSETTA].

3.  High Level Process

   This document, as extended further in OpenAPI format within
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-REDOCLY], describes the endpoints to deliver the
   Sharing Arrangement V2 capability.  The current approach to data
   sharing within the Consumer Data Right is brittle and does not
   provide sufficient feedback as to the status of sharing requests as
   they are handed over from Initiator to the Provider.  The existing
   sharing establishment process also assumes a live establishment
   rather than a potentially asynchronous, back-channel or machine to
   machine (IoT) authorisation approach.

   At a high level the process expected to be followed through the
   implementation of this specification is:

   1.  Initiator utilises a client credentials grant to obtain a token
       from the Provider;
   2.  Initiator calls the Request Sharing Agreement endpoint and
       obtains an actionId in the initial status of PENDING;
   3.  Initiator submits a pushed authorisation request with a Request
       Object containing the urn:dio:action_id parameter with a value
       equal to the actionId returned in (2)
   4.  Initiator redirects the Consumer user-agent to the Provider
       authorisation server
   5.  The Provider authorisation server completes the Consumer
       onboarding process, using any associated pre-fill supplied to the
       Initiate Energy Switch endpoint
   6.  On completion of the authorisation process the Initiator performs
       authorization_code token exchange with the Provider authorisation
       server.

   _Note 1:_ At any time before, during or after the authorisation
   process the Initiator can use the Get Sharing Agreement endpoint
   provided by the Resource Server utilising the obtained actionId.

   _Note 2:_ It is at the discretion of the Provider what resources, if
   any, are available utilising the token obtained at the end of the
   authorisation process.  In future versions fo this specification the
   token may represent an established sharing arrangement as specified
   in [DATARIGHTPLUS-SHARING-ARRANGEMENT-V2].

4.  Provider

   The following provisions apply to services delivered by Providers.

4.1.  Authorisation Server

   In addition to the provisions outlined in
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-INFOSEC-BASELINE] the authorisation server:

   1.  SHALL support the dio:action authorisation scope;
   2.  SHALL include the dio:action authorisation scope within Dynamic
       Client Registration responses;
   3.  SHALL support request objects containing an essential ID Token
       claim named urn:dio:action_id referencing a valid _Action
       Identifier_;
   4.  SHALL reject request objects containing a urn:dio:action_id claim
       that is unknown, expired or not associated with the requesting
       Initiator;

4.1.1.  Example

   The following is a non-normative example of a decoded request object
   requesting authorisation for a previously lodged actionId

   {
     "iss": "33ff17d6-d967-4823-a4d3-1206fd2fff3f",
     "exp": 1725090872,
     "nbf": 1725090872,
     "aud": "https://www.provider.com.au",
     "response_type": "code",
     "response_mode": "jwt",
     "client_id": "33ff17d6-d967-4823-a4d3-1206fd2fff3f",
     "redirect_uri": "https://www.recipient.com.au/coolstuff",
     "scope": "openid",
     "claims": {
       "id_token": {
         "urn:dio:action_id": {
           "essential": true,
           "values": ["496a3ba7-04b4-4362-b775-9e0433e48eea"]
         },
         "acr": {
           "essential": true,
           "values": ["urn:cds.au:cdr:3"]
         }
       },
       "userinfo": {
         "given_name": null,
         "family_name": null
       }
     },
     "code_challenge": "rerbvXfTDYNECzwayM8-SLCWU1FDzBnqMCv1RB5AudU",
     "code_challenge_method": "S256"
   }

4.1.2.  Claims

   The authorisation server:

   1.  SHALL include within the Introspection Endpoint response the
       urn:dio:action_id claim, containing the assigned _Action
       Identifier_;

4.2.  Resource Server

   The Provider Resource Server: 1.  SHALL support the
   initiateEnergySwitch, getEnergySwitchRequest and
   getEnergySwitchStatus endpoints as described in
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-REDOCLY]; 2.  SHALL support
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-DISCOVERY-V1] and advertise the initiateEnergySwitch,
   getEnergySwitchRequest and getEnergySwitchStatus endpoints

5.  Initiator

   The following provisions apply to participants operating Initiators.

5.1.  Authorisation Client

   In addition to the provisions outlined in Section 4 of
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-INFOSEC-BASELINE] the Initiator authorisation client:

   1.  SHALL support the Initiator provisions of
       [DATARIGHTPLUS-DISCOVERY-V1] to discover the
       initiateEnergySwitch, getEnergySwitchRequest and
       getEnergySwitchStatus endpoints;
   2.  SHALL perform a Dynamic Client Registration update, as described
       in [DATARIGHTPLUS-ADMISSION-CONTROL-00], to be granted access to
       the dio:action scope;

6.  Implementation Considerations

   This specification does not explicitly state how long an assigned
   Action Identifier persists for however it is expected that an
   Initiator shall be able to reference an Action Identifier while the
   associated authorisation is still active and for a significant period
   (more than a year) after it becomes inactive.

7.  Security Considerations

   The Action Identifier SHALL NOT be guessable, derivable nor identify
   the Consumer.
